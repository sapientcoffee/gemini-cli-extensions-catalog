## 2. Logo

### 2.1. Primary Logo
The primary logo is a stylized, golden cymbal that also forms the shape of a coffee cup as viewed from above, with a distinct ring like a coffee stain. It represents the intersection of our passion for music and coffee craftsmanship.

### 2.2. Usage
*   The logo should always be surrounded by a clear space, free of other text or graphics.
*   Do not stretch, distort, or alter the logo's colors.
*   Use the monochrome version for single-color applications.
